Possible data-generating models of longitudinal continuous outcomes and intercurrent events to investigate estimands

Preliminary work needed for simulation studies with intercurrent events and strategies for addressing intercurrent events to evaluate estimands.

Verbose and annotated R code is provided for four methods to model the joint distribution of outcomes and intercurrent events in order to simulate target trial data.

Each of the four methods can be used to simulate target trial data of outcomes and intercurrent events. A multidisciplinary approach is highly recommended to be employed in order to formulate the clinical assumptions to be mirrored by appropriate models, in order to simulate the right trials, fit for the purpose (e.g., planning of trial to be conducted and used for regulatory evaluation and approval or evaluate estimation methods of estimands).
