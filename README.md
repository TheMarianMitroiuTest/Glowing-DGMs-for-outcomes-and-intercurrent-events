Data-generating models for outcomes and intercurrent events in order to evaluate estimation methods of estimands
Preliminary work needed for an Application paper (in preparation).

Verbose and annotated R code is provided for four methods to model the joint distribution of outcomes and intercurrent events in order to simulate target trial data.

Please read the published paper first. link [TBC]

Each of the four methods can be used to simulate target trial data of outcomes and intercurrent events. A multidisciplinary approach is highly recommended to be employed in order to formulate the clinical assumptions to be mirrored by appropriate models, in order to simulate the right trials, fit for the purpose (e.g., planning of trial to be conducted and used for regulatory evaluation and approval or evaluate estimation methods of estimands).

An application companion paper will be published where multiple estimands are evaluated using this methodology.
